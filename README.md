# Retro-Cricket
Retro cricket by Venonmous purge

We have merged the game only eighty percent because of complex logics that we can't handle in limited time. 
We have created seperate files for it. The merging task was allocated to Roll no CT-272 But he didn't coordiante with us
and doesn't do the merging work. 

Our team members:
CT-259 Muhammad Nouman Fazil(group Lead)
CT-261 Mustafa Ahmed Siddiqui
CT-254 Mohammad Ali
CT-272 Afham Uddin Siddiqui
